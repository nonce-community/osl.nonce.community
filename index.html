            <p>
            <span class="nonce">nonce</span> open source lab(OSL) was established to grow vibrant open source culture of the Korean blockchain community. 
            We provide grants of up to 3.2M KRW(about $3,000) per month to open-source blockchain developers,
            enabling them to earn a livelihood while enjoying complete freedom to contribute to the projects they like.
            OSL also provides personal desks and membership services for selected contributors in nonce co-working/co-living space located at Gangnam, Seoul.<br/>
            (There is no restriction on contributors holding several jobs)<br/>
            <br/>
            Selected developers are required to give back to the community
            by means of writing articles and giving lectures, and seminars at regular interval.
            Depending on the types of membership, developers will be required to contribute to 
            either an open-source project of their choosing or one of <span class="nonce">nonce</span> community projects. 
            Community projects are carefully selected according to their potential to unlock
            the true possibilities of blockchain and decentralization.
